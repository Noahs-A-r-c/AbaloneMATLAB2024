The main file is DipoleModel.m
Although OneDimMagnitude does use the real life magnetometer data to create a best fit inverse cube rule polynomial.

You can show the cool dipole vector field by uncommenting PlotQuiver in DipoleModel.m

This program is confirmed working as a simulated proof of concept using real data as of 10/15/24 - Noah Nguyen JLAB
